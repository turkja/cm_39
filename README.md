This is a copy of [CM/Grace 3.9](http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/) with a little hack that allowed me to
use it as a emacs scheme-mode inferior Scheme. It is pretty much the
standard CM-3.9, but it also listens to S-expressions from standard input.

## How to use

Assuming Grace is compiled successfully from directory "cm", here's how to use it from emacs:

- Open .scm files you want to use with CM.
- Run M-x run-scheme (set also scheme-program-name, see below).
- CM shell opens up. If you want to have it in a new frame, set inferior-scheme-mode-hook (see below).
- Now CM accepts input from shell, or from emacs via scheme-mode evaluation.
- It is also possible to mix up input by opening files via CM GUI console.

Grace is a graphical application that pops up when run-scheme is executed, which is kinda annoying.
But you can minimize it and it shouldn't bother you anymore when you work on emacs. I didn't want
to get rid of it completely, because I'm still not sure if everything can be done from the Scheme
(MIDI/audio configuration etc.).

Ugly, yes, I know, but I can now write my notes in emacs and send them over
to CM evaluator. Emacs scheme-mode does all that stuff automagically, I just
basically defined only few things in my emacs.el:


```lisp
(setq scheme-program-name "~/bin/Grace")  ; <-- This is where I copied compiled bin/Grace
(define-key scheme-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'scheme-send-last-sexp)
(define-key scheme-mode-map (kbd "<C-M-return>") 'scheme-send-region)
(add-hook 'inferior-scheme-mode-hook (lambda ()
				       (split-window-below)))
```

In addition to this, I also did some small changes:

* Changed file chooser dialogs to JUCE from native (for some reason Gnome3 didn't like them)
* Patched brutally, without knowing what I'm doing 'lround' -> 'ljround' in juce/modules/juce_audio_formats/codecs/flac/libFLAC/lpc_flac.c (Hey, works for me!)
* Some tweaks to colors in the JUCE code editor (which I don't use anymore)
* Prevent main console GUI popping up on errors
* (quit) now works from the Scheme
